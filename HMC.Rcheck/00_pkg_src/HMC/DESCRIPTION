Description: This package provide interpretable High-dimensional Mean Comparison methods (HMC). For example, users can use them to assess the difference of gene expression between two treatment groups. It is not a gene-by-gene comparison. Instead, we focus on the interplay between features and are interested in those are predictive of the group label. The methods are valid frequentist tests and give sparse estimate indicating which features contribute to the test results.
