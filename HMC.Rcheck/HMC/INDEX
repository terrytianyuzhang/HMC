anchored_lasso_testing
                        Simple plug-in test for two-sample mean
                        comparison.
debiased_pc_testing     Debiased one-step test for two-sample mean
                        comparison. A small p-value tells us not only
                        there is difference in the mean vectors, but
                        can also indicates which principle component
                        the difference aligns with.

index_spliter           Split the sample index into n_folds many groups
                        so that we can perform cross-fitting

                        comparison.
summarize_feature_name
                        Summarize the features (e.g. genes) that
                        contribute to the test result, i.e. those
                        features consistently show up in Lasso vectors.
summarize_pc_name       Summarize the features (e.g. genes) that
                        contribute to the test result, i.e. those
                        features consistently show up in the sparse
                        principle components.
