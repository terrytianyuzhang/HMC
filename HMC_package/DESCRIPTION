Description: 
    Provides interpretable high-dimensional mean comparison methods (HMC). 
    For example, users can apply these methods to assess the difference in 
    gene expression between two treatment groups. It is not a gene-by-gene 
    comparison. Instead, the methods focus on the interplay between features 
    and identify those that are predictive of the group label. The tests are 
    valid frequentist procedures and yield sparse estimates indicating which 
    features contribute to the group differences.
